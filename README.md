# 🧠 Breast Cancer Detection using Decision Tree & Random Forest

This project aims to **detect breast cancer** using machine learning algorithms applied to the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment, and this project explores two powerful classification models — **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** — to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various cell features.

This notebook demonstrates the full workflow from data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model building, evaluation, and performance comparison.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. It includes:

- 10 numeric attributes related to characteristics of the cell nuclei.
- 1 target variable:  
  - `M` = Malignant (cancerous)  
  - `B` = Benign (non-cancerous)
